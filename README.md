# crxML
Supervised Machine Learning with Credit Approval Data
Python3

No requirements file. You need pandas and sklearn installed.

This project uses supervised machine learning algorithms to predict if someone should be approved for a credit card. The data comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Credit+Approval). I converted the .data file into a .csv for simplicity.

To use:
Go to main and input the string corresponding to the ML model you want to test.
You can Switch between ML models to see what works best by simply choosing between 'DT', 'GB', 'KN', 'LC', 'LR'
